Ports 1–1023 are privileged ports.
Examples of privileged ports:


----
listener.Close() releases the listening socket and unblocks Accept().
defer ? -> defer guarantees it’s released when the program exits
--


go function_name : is  goroutine ????


--

A .go file must always start with package <name> — even if it has no code yet.
---
Go only allows := when at least one variable is new.
_ is not a variable
_ in Go = blank identifier

It means:

“I don’t care about this value.”
------
In Go, Capital Letter = Public (Exported). Lowercase = Private (Hidden).


----
json.newDecoder(str) -> DOES NOT TAKE A STRING 
it take ( files , network connections , buffers , streams)

---
type Request struct 
{
   First_number int  `json:"first"`
   Second_number int `json:"second"`
}

func main() {

  
  str := `{  "first" : 1 , "second" : 2 }` // so basically this is a string 

when try to map varibale into struct 
try to use struct tag instead of actual variables

aka : `json:"Nmae"`
----
  

go mod ( path ) : update your go.mod file 

Docker does NOT send stdout and stderr separately. Instead:

it multiplexes them into one binary stream

prefixes frames with headers

You cannot “import another file” in the same package in Go.
