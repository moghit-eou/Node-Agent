# Node Agent

A distributed Remote Code Execution (RCE) Agent built in Go. This service listens for incoming execution jobs via TCP, processes them, and safely executes code inside isolated Docker containers.

## Architecture

The agent follows a strict layered architecture to ensure separation of concerns:

1.  **Network Layer (`internal/network`)**: Handles TCP connections and protocol parsing.
2.  **Control Layer (`internal/control`)**: Manages business logic and job routing.
3.  **Execution Layer (`internal/execution`)**: Interfaces with the Docker Engine to create ephemeral sandboxes for code execution.
